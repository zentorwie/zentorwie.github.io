Hi, everyone! Welcome to my blog.

This blog is set up with Octopress, which is a blogging framework for hackers.

From now on, I will maintain this site at least once a week, and I will post some insteresting ideas I come up with to share with you. Also, I'll post some notes about GNU/Linux, Emacs, programming, etc.

For some technological reasons, the posts cannot be commented yet. I may not enable the comment function because the site is set up to post things only. If you want to contact me or share your ideas with me, you can turn to my G+ page and you're appreciated.
